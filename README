	Revision 348
	http://svn.as3.casalib.org/releases/latest/code/

Note
	For targets other than Flash, casahx needs nme, neash and canvas-nme.

	All the codes in the repo is maintained to be already tested on ALL haxe targets, except:
	NumberUtil.isNumber(), due to inconsistence of Std.parseFloat between targets, some weired expression may fail on some platform. But normal integer/float is ok and consistant(Please check List of test case in test.TestUtil.testNumberUtil()).
