Ported from...
	Casalib
	Revision 348
	http://svn.as3.casalib.org/releases/latest/code/

Note
	For targets other than Flash, casahx needs nme, neash and canvas-nme.

	All the codes in the repo is maintained to be already tested on ALL haxe targets, except:
	NumberUtil.isNumber(), due to inconsistence of Std.parseFloat between targets, some weired expression may fail on some platform. But normal integer/float is ok and consistant(Please check List of test case in test.TestUtil.testNumberUtil()).
	
	There are some functions different from the original casalib:
	-added UInt (org.casalib.core) : Used internally to make it usable in non-Flash targets.
	-ArrayUtil
		added indexOf		: Same as AS3's Array
		added lastIndexOf	: Same as AS3's Array
		added filter			: Same as AS3's Array
	-DateUtil
		added getTimezoneOffset : Same as AS3's Date
